### API Quick Reference

```python
# Standard generation
response = client.images.generate(
    model="gpt-image-2",
    prompt="your prompt here",
    size="1024x1024",      # 1024x1024, 1536x1024, 1024x1536, auto
    quality="high",         # standard, high
    n=1,

# Image editing (inpainting)
response = client.images.edit(
    model="gpt-image-2",
    image=open("original.png", "rb"),
    mask=open("mask.png", "rb"),
    prompt="your edit prompt here",
)
```

### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be specific about style** — Mention film stock (35mm), camera type (iPhone, CCD), or art movement
2. **Describe lighting explicitly** — "harsh fluorescent mixed with neon glow" beats "good lighting"
3. **Specify aspect ratio** — Add `--ar 9:16` or `aspect ratio 3:4` for non-square outputs
4. **Use negative cues** — "no plastic skin, no watermark, no text" helps avoid common artifacts
5. **Reference real-world context** — Mention specific games, apps, or brands for style replication
6. **Layer details** — GPT-Image-2 handles long, detailed prompts better than shorter ones
